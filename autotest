# .autotest is the user-specific global configuration file for the Ruby Autotest tool, which is part
# of the ZenTest gem. It must exist in $HOME or be specified on the command line, with the command
# line having higher precedence. Configuration within this file will be merged with configuration
# within tree-specific configuration files and command-line options, with configuration within tree-
# specific files overriding configuration within this file, and both overriding command-line
# options, where applicable. See:
#
#     http://zentest.rubyforge.org/ZenTest

# for more information.

# Use the fsevent and Growl plugins. These will probably only work on OS X.
