These are my dotfiles. There are many others like them, but these ones are mine.

copydot.py is a work-in-progress intended to help me manage my dual Windows and OS X
life. It needs a lot of work, and so do my dotfiles in general, particularly with
respect to git and vim. I hope to do this work soon.
