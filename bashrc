# .bashrc is the user-specific configuration file for the Bourne Again Shell (bash). It must exist
# in $HOME and will be sourced by bash after system-wide configuration files in /etc for all non-
# login shells..bashrc is used
# for non-login interactive shells (e.g. Terminal), while .bash_profile is used for
# login shells (e.g. remote ssh).
# See http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html for information on
# bash startup file execution precedence.
# See http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/profile.html for what should go where.

# TBD: Some more links to read:

# TBD: address OS X specifics, organize the file much better than it is, clean up comments for
# consistency, how much of this should go in...~/Code/scripts? ~/bin?

# Change readline to vi mode for bash shells. See ~/.inputrc for non-bash applications as well as
# for vi keymap modifications that apply to all readline-using programs, including bash.

# TBD: This seems to have troubles with my color prompt stuff :( Actually, it only seems to be an
# issue when using an arg count with 'b' at this point, so 2w works, www works, bbb works, but 2b is
# messed up, unfortunately it will take more investigation

# does. ls -le?

# Modern Xcode on OS X installs Git inside the application bundle. Use the Git that comes with Xcode

# TBD: Now that all the colors stuff is nice and non-os-specific, make some nice colors based on
# monique or whatever.

# Define a function that will output each of the 16 ANSI color numbers and LSCOLORS identifiers to
# the terminal in the actual corresponding color. This can be used to check color mappings in
# terminals that allow for the ANSI colors to be overridden.

}

# Define a few colors for later use. The escaped brackets tell bash that they are non-printable and
# keep word-wrapping sane. The colors are defined with their ANSI color numbers rather than their
# names because the actual colors may not correspond to the classic names if the RGB for the stock
# colors are redefined in a terminal that supports this feature in its preferences or profiles.
