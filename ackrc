# TBD: the whole file isn't overridden, but individual commands are overridden. Figure a way to make this
# clear for the three open files here and try not to take all damned day.

# .ackrc is the user-specific global configuration file for ack. It must exist in $HOME or be
# specified by $ACKRC, with $ACKRC having higher precedence. No other system- or tree-specific
# configuration files exist for it to override, and it will be overridden by command-line options.
# See:
