# .ackrc is the user-specific global configuration file for ack. It must exist in $HOME or be
# specified by $ACKRC, with $ACKRC having higher precedence. No other system- or tree-specific
# configuration files exist for it to override. Configuration within this file will be merged with
# command-line options, with command-line options overriding configuration within this file where
# applicable. See:
#
#     http://betterthangrep.com/documentation/man.html#the__ackrc_file

# for more information.

# Add Arduino and Processing file types.
